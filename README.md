# DKLiveChat
DK Live Chat is an Android Library product from DabKick, Inc. that allows developers to deploy live group chat for their Android application.

Live Group Chat library product, when integrated in an application, allows users to quickly enter a public space and browse ongoing live chat messages, and to participate in that chat, in context of that browsing data, with like-minded users browsing that same information at the same time. Customer service providers and staff members could also join and participate and provide special assistance to all users browsing that information.

Along with the library, and an easy to follow integration video, a sample application is provided to developers in order to demonstrate how live group chat can be offered to existing users easily and with minimal effort.

                                          How does DK LiveChat work? 

Chat 'rooms' are created for users to congregate and to send and receive messages. It is a simple and intuitive concept and easy for users to grasp. Everyone in a chat room receives all messages sent to the room. The available list of all chat rooms are presented to users, as also the list of people in the rooms. 

Users can decide to join (and subscribe to) any of the rooms available, or create a room of their own, and send and receive messages exchanging their thoughts with all other users in that room. User also can just subscribe to a room (not joining, just subscribing) and listen-in on the messages going back and forth in that room. 

They can join or subscribe to multiple rooms at the same time. They can leave a room and stay subscribed in it, listening to conversations there, or just leave and unsubscribe, in which case they will no longer be listening in on the conversations in that room.

                                         What are the use cases?

There are numerous use cases for a live chat capability where groups of people come in to chat about a common interest - be it an art piece in a museum they are curious about, a music event and its logistics such as venue and price, or an item on sale they'd consider purchasing. 

So an  application can bring customers together to chat about a sales or support function (for instance, e-commerce) or an organizing or coordination function (for instance, event logistics) or informational reasons (museum art). In each of these cases, it is useful to allow users to interact with other users currently IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME, browsing that object or event. 

A customer support function may also allow for a host to be present in the room at all times to moderate interactions, and address common questions or issues. In all these cases, a quick integration of the application with the DK LiveChat library will provide the means to create and deploy that experience without worries about server set up or long learning curves or installation time for developers. 

Its a quick deployment of a highly functional multi-room group live chat capability from DabKick that Android developers find easy to deploy - and users have come to love.
